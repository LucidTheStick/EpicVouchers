## Introduction
EpicVouchers is simple to use voucher plugin, that gives you the ability to reward players automatically without needing to give them permission to a command or manually run a command on a player yourself. This plugin is perfect for cosmetic rewards, selling in-game ranks, crate and kit rewards, unique shop designs, etc. The plugin also features an in-game GUI that allows you to create, edit and delete vouchers without needing to configurate the files, or restart/reload the server to apply the changes. It's a perfect plugin for production servers, and gives you unlimited ways to reward your loyal players easily.

## Developers API
Here is an example with built-in methods for developers that want to use the EpicVouchers API for their own resources. This is a pretty long example, so take that into consideration when looking at the example, but I am sure that you will understand the usage of it quickly.

```ruby
@EventHandler
public void redeemListener(VoucherRedeemEvent event) {
# Returns the player that redeemed the voucher.
Player player = event.getPlayer();
# Returns the name of the redeemed voucher.
String voucher = event.getVoucher();
# Returns the ItemStack of the redeemed voucher.
ItemStack item = event.getItem();
# Returns if the voucher was redeemed manual or not.
boolean manual = event.getManual();
# Returns if the event is cancelled or not.
boolean cancelled = event.isCancelled();
# Get a list of handlers for this event.
HandlerList handlers = event.getHandlers();
# Cancel the event with a boolean.
event.isCancelled(true);
}

@EventHandler
public void forceListener(ForceRedeemEvent event) {
# Returns the player that redeemed the voucher.
Player player = event.getPlayer();
# Returns the name of the redeemed voucher.
String voucher = event.getVoucher();
# Returns the amount of vouchers that were redeemed.
int amount = event.getAmount();
# Returns the sender that forced the players.
CommandSender sender = event.getSender();
# Returns if the event is cancelled or not.
boolean cancelled = event.isCancelled();
# Get a list of handlers for this event.
HandlerList handlers = event.getHandlers();
# Cancel the event with a boolean.
event.isCancelled(true);
}

@EventHandler
public void receiveListener(VoucherReceiveEvent event) {
# Returns the player that received the voucher.
Player player = event.getPlayer();
# Returns the name of the received voucher.
String voucher = event.getVoucher();
# Returns the ItemStack of the received voucher.
ItemStack item = event.getItem();
# Returns the amount of vouchers that were received.
int amount = event.getAmount();
# Returns the sender that gave the vouchers.
CommandSender sender = event.getSender();
# Returns if the event is cancelled or not.
boolean cancelled = event.isCancelled();
# Get a list of handlers for this event.
HandlerList handlers = event.getHandlers();
# Cancel the event with a boolean.
