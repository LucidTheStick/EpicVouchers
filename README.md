## Introduction

EpicVouchers is simple to use voucher plugin, that gives you the ability to reward players automatically without needing
to give them permission to a command or manually run a command on a player yourself. This plugin is perfect for cosmetic
rewards, selling in-game ranks, crate and kit rewards, unique shop designs, etc. The plugin also features an in-game GUI
that allows you to create, edit and delete vouchers without needing to configurate the files, or restart/reload the
server to apply the changes. It's a perfect plugin for production servers, and gives you unlimited ways to reward your
loyal players easily.

## Developers API

Here is an example with built-in methods for developers that want to use the EpicVouchers API for their own resources.
This is a pretty long example, so take that into consideration when looking at the example, but I am sure that you will
understand the usage of it quickly.

```java
public class VouchersExample implements Listener {
  @EventHandler
  public void onRedeem(VoucherRedeemEvent event) {
    // Returns the player that redeemed the voucher.
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    // Returns the name of the redeemed voucher.
    String voucher = event.getVoucher();
    // Returns the ItemStack of the redeemed voucher.
    ItemStack item = event.getItem();
    // Returns if the voucher was redeemed manual or not.
    boolean manual = event.getManual();
    // Returns if the event is cancelled or not.
    boolean cancelled = event.isCancelled();
    // Get a list of handlers for this event.
    HandlerList handlers = event.getHandlers();
    // Cancel the event with a boolean.
    event.setCancelled(true);
  }

  @EventHandler
  public void onForceRedeem(ForceRedeemEvent event) {
    // Returns the player that redeemed the voucher.
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    // Returns the name of the redeemed voucher.
    String voucher = event.getVoucher();
    // Returns the amount of vouchers that were redeemed.
    int amount = event.getAmount();
    // Returns the sender that forced the players.
    CommandSender sender = event.getSender();
    // Returns if the event is cancelled or not.
    boolean cancelled = event.isCancelled();
    // Get a list of handlers for this event.
    HandlerList handlers = event.getHandlers();
    // Cancel the event with a boolean.
    event.setCancelled(true);
  }

  @EventHandler
  public void onReceive(VoucherReceiveEvent event) {
    // Returns the player that received the voucher.
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    // Returns the name of the received voucher.
    String voucher = event.getVoucher();
    // Returns the ItemStack of the received voucher.
    ItemStack item = event.getItem();
    // Returns the amount of vouchers that were received.
    int amount = event.getAmount();
    // Returns the sender that gave the vouchers.
    CommandSender sender = event.getSender();
    // Returns if the event is cancelled or not.
    boolean cancelled = event.isCancelled();
    // Get a list of handlers for this event.
    HandlerList handlers = event.getHandlers();
    // Cancel the event with a boolean.
    event.setCancelled(true);
  }
}
